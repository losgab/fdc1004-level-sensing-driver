# Capacitive Liquid-Level Sensor for Resin-Infused IPA
- Designed a proof-of-concept prototype liquid level sensor for upcoming auto-washing product for resin 3D prints
- Designed pad probe layout on custom PCB using both Autodesk Eagle, Altium Designer
- Wrote custom driver code for Arduino, Espressif Systems and STM32 frameworks
- Finetuned auto-calibration algorithm for specific application with changing resin & IPA concentrations
